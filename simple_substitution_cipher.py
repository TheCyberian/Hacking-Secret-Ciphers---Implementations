"""
To implement the simple substitution cipher, choose a random letter to encrypt each letter of the alphabet.
Use each letter once and only once. The key will end up being a string of 26 letters of the alphabet in random order.
There are 26! possible keys, which is equal to 26*25*24*.....*2*1 = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible orderings for keys.
Pretty much impossible to brute force with the current computing power.

Although the number of possible keys is very large (26! â‰ˆ 288.4, or about 88 bits),
this cipher is not very strong, and is easily broken.
Provided the message is of reasonable length (see below),
the cryptanalyst can deduce the probable meaning of the most common symbols by doing a simple frequency distribution analysis
 of the ciphertext. Pattern analysis.
